# Newton-Raphson Method Implementation

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Newton-Raphson method for finding roots of a given function. The Newton-Raphson method is a root-finding algorithm that uses the first derivative of a function to find its roots.

## Features

- Accepts a function and its derivative as input.
- Implements the Newton-Raphson method to find the root of the function.
- Prints the root and the number of iterations required to find it.
